                Before starting Archer Bay Capital, Terri spent twenty-five years managing money for large 
                institutions – banks, insurance, pensions, endowments, and mutual funds. She knew the investment 
                process used by these firms worked for individual investors as well, but too often she saw 
                individual portfolios that were overly complex, with sub-par investment returns and 
                a lack of transparency. Terri started Archer Bay Capital to offer the personal financial 
                advice and solid investment performance that she saw was missing - in a cost-effective way.
